# Threat Hunt Report
**Detection of Unauthorized TOR Browser Installation and Use**

## Example Scenario:
Management suspects that some employees may be using TOR browsers to bypass network security controls because recent network logs show unusual encrypted traffic patterns and connections to known TOR entry nodes. Additionally, there have been anonymous reports of employees discussing ways to access restricted sites during work hours. The goal is to detect any TOR usage and analyze related security incidents to mitigate potential risks.

## High-Level TOR related IoC Discovery Plan:
1. Check DeviceFileEvents for any tor(.exe) or firefox(.exe) file events
2. Check DeviceProcessEvents for any signs of installation or useage
3. Check DeviceNetworkEvents for any signs of outgoing connections over known TOR ports

## Detection Queries:
```kql
// Installer name == tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-(version).exe
// Detect the installer being downloaded
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName startswith "tor"

// TOR Browser being silently installed
// Take note of two spaces before the /S (I don't know why)
DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.1.exe  /S"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, ProcessCommandLine

// TOR Browser or service was successfully installed and is present on the disk
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName has_any ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe")
| project  Timestamp, DeviceName, RequestAccountName, ActionType, InitiatingProcessCommandLine

// TOR Browser or service was launched
DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any("tor.exe","firefox.exe")
| project  Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine

// TOR Browser or service is being used and is actively creating network connections
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in~ ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe")
| where RemotePort in (9001, 9030, 9040, 9050, 9051, 9150)
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, InitiatingProcessFileName, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl
| order by Timestamp desc

// User shopping list was created and, changed, or deleted
DeviceFileEvents
